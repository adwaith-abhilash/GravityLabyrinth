## Decription

This game was developed as part of an assignment for an internship selection process. The base layer of the game was provided by the company, and I built upon it to create a gameplay experience focused on gravity manipulation. The objective is to collect all the cubes within a limited time while being careful not to fall into the void, which adds an extra challenge to the game.
